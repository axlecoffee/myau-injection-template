# Myau Injection Template

"hey claude decompile this bih"

## THIS PROJECT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY MODULES OF USE - I MIGHT MAKE SOME IN THE FUTURE

This project is a 1:1 prot of Myau+-1.0.3 (20122025) beta1 weekly patch 3 posted in Myau Private/#configs

I decompiled Myau+ to allow other people (and myself) to have an easy-to-use template to inject features into Myau

All credits go to chloewasstolen and maybsomeday on discord for actually figuring out the proper fields and methods to inject into! I simply read their code and stripped it to be a template

The codebase is based on nea89's Forge 1.8.9 template (with kotlin)

You need PAID Myau client for this

All the injection only works (probably) for Myau-250910 PAID myau NOT openmyau

meow :3

if you have questions dm me or them (my discord is @axle.coffee )

# Check out my other project: https://github.com/axlecoffee/CoffeeClient where I shimmed OpenMyau into Lunar Client using NotEnoughUpdates !
